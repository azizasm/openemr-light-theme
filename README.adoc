== Starlight ==

This is a modern theme for the OpenEMR project. It uses the Foundation framework as a base.

=== Installing ===
This repo contains the various components needed to build a final style_light.css. To install into a working OpenEMR instance you can either download a zipped release from the releases page or clone the repo locally and build yourself. Once you have the style_starlight.css place it in <openemr_base_dir>/interface/themes/ directory.

==== Building ====
Starlight uses http://gruntjs.com/[Grunt] to build the final output and http://bower.io/[Bower] manage dependencies. You do not need to be familiar with these to build the final css, but they must be installed.

===== Steps to build =====
(From root of starlight dir)

* Install required node packages
* Run bower to retrieve dependencies
* Run grunt to build css
* Compiled CSS file is located under css/
